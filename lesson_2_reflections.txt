1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	A hidden .git file is created containing metadata.  This will be used to track data relating to the files within your repository and their version information.
2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area does not actually save anything so you can pick and choose what files out of a working directory/repository you want to be part of a commit instead of automatically making all files part of the commit.  This provides more control over what goes into each commit.
